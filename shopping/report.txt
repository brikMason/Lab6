First off, their interface could use some work. Had to type in most (all) of the code to generate the diagram. 
Overall, the Umple code is a lot more complicated than what I did. It tried filling up the methods with what it 
thought it needed, and created other methods.

Umple could be useful for explaining code to clients who don't program, as it would give them a visual representation
of what is happening. For a programmer, it might be helpful to imagine what the class/function/method would look like 
after being created. It is also very robust since it can do many languages.
